# ShapeLogic Rust

Image processing and coputer vision experiments in Rust.

This project is meant investigate how easy it is do image processing and computer vision programming in Rust, 
in comparison to using Scala and TypeScript/WebGL.

## Sister project ##

* [ShapeLogic Scala](https://github.com/sami-badawi/shapelogic-scala)
* [ShapeLogic TypeScript](https://github.com/sami-badawi/shapelogic-typescript)

All 3 are modern languages with very sophisticated type systems.

## Goals ##

* Get some image processing algorithms working from command line script
* Start porting algorithms from ShapeLogic Scala
* Figure out what to do about a GUI, possibly web based on

## GUI Ideas ##

To begin with the GUI can be rudementary.

* Single page web application, possibly based on work in [ShapeLogic TypeScript](https://github.com/sami-badawi/shapelogic-typescript)
* Gtk og Gnome Rust bindings
* SDL2 game engine bindings
* Cursive / ncurses old but powerful GUI show image in browser
  
## Status ##

Vaporware. In a cool new language. :D
