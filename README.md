# ShapeLogic Rust

Image processing and coputer vision experiments in Rust.

This project is meant investigate how easy it is do image processing and computer vision programming in Rust, 
in comparison to using Scala and TypeScript/WebGL.

## Sister project ##

* [ShapeLogic Scala](https://github.com/sami-badawi/shapelogic-scala)
* [ShapeLogic TypeScript](https://github.com/sami-badawi/shapelogic-typescript)

All 3 are modern languages with very sophisticated type systems.
